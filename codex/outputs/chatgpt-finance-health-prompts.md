# ChatGPT finance and health prompts

Source: `app.asar` of the Codex/ChatGPT desktop app 26.928.21956 (build 12404), SHA-256 `3bda98f2265ad23677dfe0163d1cc7855beade6bef11d27f830f6663d7658406`.

Messages the app sends for ChatGPT's personal finance features (manual accounts and newly connected accounts) and the hidden context message for a selected Health record.

ChatGPT's own system prompt is not in the app; the servers add it. The phrase "You are ChatGPT" occurs in none of the app's scripts.

Each entry says whether its text is exact (one literal in the bundle) or assembled (literal pieces joined as the app joins them). Entries with a message id or translator note are formatjs messages: the text shown is the English source (`defaultMessage`), and the app sends the model whatever the user's language translates it to.

## Manual accounts

### Manual account: cash

Source: `webview/assets/CompilerIntrinsics-22af5c6c35d0.js`, offset 355860, SHA-256 `7cb7157a5301cd54123329cb032e188baf09d56ad47975796c707863683faa65`.

Exact text from the bundle.

Translator note: User message automatically sent to ChatGPT when a user selects the Cash manual-account category. Ask one short question at a time for the account name, checking or savings subtype, and current balance; the institution is optional and currency is needed only if unclear. Save a separate account as a financial memory only after the user answers. Preserve the first-person request.
