# ChatGPT Sites and artifacts prompts

Source: `app.asar` of the Codex/ChatGPT desktop app 26.928.21956 (build 12404), SHA-256 `3bda98f2265ad23677dfe0163d1cc7855beade6bef11d27f830f6663d7658406`.

Messages for ChatGPT Sites (publishing, automations, custom domains) and the context the app adds when a task starts from the Library or a writing block.

ChatGPT's own system prompt is not in the app; the servers add it. The phrase "You are ChatGPT" occurs in none of the app's scripts.

Each entry says whether its text is exact (one literal in the bundle) or assembled (literal pieces joined as the app joins them). Entries with a message id or translator note are formatjs messages: the text shown is the English source (`defaultMessage`), and the app sends the model whatever the user's language translates it to.

## Sites
