# ChatGPT conversation prompts

Source: `app.asar` of the Codex/ChatGPT desktop app 26.928.20755 (build 12246), SHA-256 `2301fba40bd8fa237ccdb1369363e1deefaf27953da2d767d428225d5e9eedee`.

Text the app adds to ChatGPT conversations: the regenerate-with-feedback instruction, the sponsored-ad system message, the onboarding kickoff, image-edit and flight-search requests, and the tool results of the ChatGPT-to-Codex handoff.

ChatGPT's own system prompt is not in the app; the servers add it. The phrase "You are ChatGPT" occurs in none of the app's scripts.

Each entry says whether its text is exact (one literal in the bundle) or assembled (literal pieces joined as the app joins them). Entries with a message id or translator note are formatjs messages: the text shown is the English source (`defaultMessage`), and the app sends the model whatever the user's language translates it to.

## Conversation turns

### Regenerate with feedback

Source: `webview/assets/chatgpt-conversation-turn-content-2cdcde8113f5.js`, offset 287229, SHA-256 `d68556b8a8cac27620e6c3fca92aa36debd19bd595957d8b899ebf69130d4a9d`.

Exact text from the bundle.

```text
The user provided feedback on a previous completion. Use it to generate a new completion. The output should be a standalone response that reflects the feedback without acknowledging it. Do not mention, suggest, or imply that this is a revision, improvement, or result of feedback. Respond in the same language as the original completion, even if the feedback is in another language. Only switch if the feedback explicitly asks you to translate the completion. Here is the feedback:
```

Exact text from the bundle. Default of the `ask_chatgpt_system_message` remote config value; the server can replace it. The app fills `{LABEL}` and `{DATA}` from the ad.

Please update my flight search. Current details: {tripType, select, round_trip {Round trip} other {One way}}; from {hasOrigin, select, yes {{origin}} other {Not specified}} to {hasDestination, select, yes {{destination}} other {Not specified}}; departure {hasDeparture, select, yes {{departureDate}} other {Not specified}}; return {tripType, select, one_way {No return flight} other {{hasReturn, select, yes {{returnDate}} other {Not specified}}}}; adults {partySize}; {cabinClass, select, premium_economy {Premium economy} business {Business} first {First} other {Economy}}; {connections, plural, =-1 {Any number of stops} =0 {Nonstop only} one {At most # stop in each direction} other {At most # stops in each direction}}.
